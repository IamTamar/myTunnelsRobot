In recent years, terror tunnels have become increasingly common and dangerous.
this project's aim is life saving : the robot would scan these tunnels instead of people.
This autonomous robot designed to navigate and map narrow tunnels, detect humans and weapon stockpiles, and report hazardous gas levels.

Features
3D mapping using LiDAR

Object detection (YOLOv8 and custom CNN)

Gas anomaly detection (dual gas sensors)

Wall-following navigation (right-hand rule with dynamic left-turn override)
